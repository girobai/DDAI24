# RUNNING THE ADVENTURE 

THIS BOOK IS WRITTEN FOR THE DUNGEON MASTER. 

It contains a complete DUNGEONS & DRAGONS adventure, as well as descriptions for every creature that appears in the adventure. It also teaches you how to run a D&D game.
The other book that accompanies this one (called "the rulebook") contains the information the players need to create and advance their characters (the adventurers and heroes of the story), as well as the rules you need to adjudicate situations that arise during the adventure.

# OVERVIEW

A D&D adventure is a collection of locations, quests, and challenges that inspires you to tell a story. The outcome of that story is determined by the actions and decisions of
the adventurers-and, of course, the luck of the dice. You can run Dragon of Icespire Peak for as few as one player
or as many as five players. Each player starts with a 1st level character.
The adventure is set a short distance from the city of Neverwinter in the Sword Coast region of the Forgotten Realms setting. The Sword Coast is part of the North a vast realm of free settlements surrounded by lawless, untamed wilderness. You don't need to be a Forgotten Realms expert to run the adventure, as everything you need to know about the setting is contained in this book. If this is your first time running a D&D adventure, read the "Role of the Dungeon Master" section.

# ROLE OF THE DUNGEON MASTER

The Dungeon Master (also called "the DM") has a special role in the D&D game.
The DM is a referee. When it's not clear what ought to happen next, the DM decides how to apply the rules and keep the story going.
The DM is a storyteller. The DM sets the pace of the story and presents the various challenges and encounters that the players must overcome. The DM is the players' interface to the D&D world, as well as the one who reads (and sometimes also writes) the adventure and describes what happens in response to the characters' actions.
The DM is a roleplayer. The DM plays the monsters and villains in the adventure, choosing their actions and rolling dice for their attacks. The DM also plays the parts of all the other characters who the adventurers meet, in- cluding helpful ones.
The most important thing to remember about being a good DM is that the rules are a tool to help you and the players have fun. The rules aren't in charge. You're the D-you're in charge of the game.
CHOOSING A DUNGEON MASTER
Who should be the DM for your gaming group? Whoever wants to be! The person who has the most drive to pull a group together and start up a game often ends up being the DM by default, but that doesn't have to be the case.

# DM TIPS

As the DM, you are the final authority when it comes to rules questions or disputes during the game. Here are some guidelines to help you arbitrate issues as they arise.
When in doubt, make it up. It's better to keep the game moving than to get bogged down in the rules. Embrace the shared story. D&D is about telling a story as a group, so let the players contribute to the outcome through the words and deeds of their characters. If
some players are reluctant to speak up, remember to ask them what their characters are doing.
It's not a competition. The DM isn't competing against the player characters. Your job is to referee the rules,
run monsters, and keep the story moving.
Be consistent and fair. If you decide that a rule works a certain way, make sure ti works that way the next time it comes into play. Treat the rules and your players in a
fair, impartial manner.
Modify the adventure to suit your tastes. The adventure has no prescribed outcome. You can alter any encounter to make it more interesting and fun for your particular group of players.
Keep a notepad and some graph paper handy. Use the notepad to keep track of details such as the characters' marching order. Graph paper will be helpful fi you need to draw a quick map for your players.
IMPROVISING ABILITY CHECKS
The adventure often tells you what ability checks char- acters might try in a certain situation, and the Difficulty Class (DC) of those checks. Sometimes characters try things that the adventure can't possibly anticipate. You decide whether their attempts are successful.
Ability checks only come into play if there's a genuine chance of succeeding or failing at the task. If it seems like anyone should have an easy time doing it, don't ask
for an ability check. Just tell the player what happens. Conversely, if there's no way anyone could accomplish the task, just tell the player ti doesn't work.
If and when you decide that an ability check is required, ask yourself these questions:
What Kind o f Ability Check? Use the descriptions of the ability scores and their associated skills in the rule- book to help you decide what kind of ability check to use. How Hard Is It? Decide whether the task's difficulty is easy, moderate, or hard, and use the appropriate DC.
DC 10 (Easy). An easy task requires a minimal level of competence or a modicum of luck to accomplish.
DC 15 (Moderate). A moderate task requires a higher level of competence to accomplish. Acharacter with natural aptitude and specialized training can accom- plish a moderate task more often than not.
DC 20 (Hard). Hard tasks include things beyond the capabilities of most people without aid or exceptional ability. Even with aptitude and training, a character needs some amount of luck or a lot of specialized training-to pull of a hard task.
OTHER COMPONENTS
The box containing this adventure includes components designed to help you as the Dungeon Master. In addition to the rulebook, these components are as follows:
DM SCREEN
The inside of the folding screen has information that can
help you while running the adventure. You can also use the screen to hide your notes and die rolls, thus keeping the players in suspense.
POSTER MAP
When you're ready to begin the adventure, unfold the poster map so that the map of Phandalin faces up. Here is where the adventure begins. When it comes time for players to embark on quests, use the Sword Coast map on the reverse side to help chart their overland journey.
CARDS
The box contains the following cards:
Combat Step by Step Cards. These identical cards out- line the order of combat, as described in the rulebook.
Condition Cards. These cards describe various condi- tions that can affect creatures in the game. A player whose character is suffering from a condition can keep the card as a reminder, giving it back to you when the condition ends for that character.
Initiative Cards. After the characters and each group of monsters involved in a combat roll initiative, distribute these cards among the combat participants, from the
highest to lowest initiative count. For example, whoever rolls the highest initiative gets the "1" card and acts first, whoever rolls the second highest initiative gets the "2" card, and so on. Keep the numbered cards for the creatures you're running.
Magic Charm Card. This card describes a special charm (see "Charm of the Storm," page 41). Give the card
to the player whose character receives the charm. Col- lect the card when the charm ends for that character.
Magic Item Cards. When the characters acquire a magic item and identify it, give the players the card for that item. Let the player whose character has the item keep the card for reference until the item is expended or no longer in that character's possession.
Quest Cards. When a new quest becomes available to the characters, give that quest's card to the players. Collect the card fi the characters complete the quest or
decide they don't want to complete it.
Sidekick Cards. If you're running the game for a single player, give the player these cards and let them choose a sidekick. The sidekick's corresponding stat block can be found in the rulebook. fI the sidekick dies, collect the card; the player can't choose that sidekick again.
